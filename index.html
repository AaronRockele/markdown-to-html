<h2>pro's</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>build in live browser view is great! if you work on css it even highlight the the tag your working on.</li>  
        <li>it's a free open source program that's also *cross platform*.</li>
        <li>Brackets is being actively maintained and developed.</li>
    </ol>
    
<h2>cons</h2>
   
    <ul>
        <li>the live browser view only works with chrome.</li>
        <li>since brackets is an open source software, it is always inproving. so if you feel like there is lacking something after a while it will probably be added in a software update.</li>
        <li>it would be nice if brackets had a sharing function. so you could easy share your code between users so they could help you work on you projects. but hey there you got github for!</li>
    </ul>       
    
<h2>why do i use it?</h2>
 
 <p>that's very easy. i use it because i know it. i learned this in school and just kept using it  and it has never failed me. well didn't do much more then HTML and CSS so i might find some difficulties when i have to use it for heavier things. </p>
  
<p>"Brackets is a very attractive and visually attractive code editor for the development of code, especially very useful for the development of web applications due to its support for php, css and javascript for those who implement the auto-completion function in a very accurate way and intuitive." - happy user </p>
